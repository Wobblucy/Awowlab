// Boss phase tracking. Retail combat logs carry no phase markers, so
// phases are derived from the fight itself. A rule marks where a new
// phase starts, and re-applies automatically to every pull of that
// encounter. Three rule kinds:
//   SpellCast - first cast of a boss ability starts the phase
//   Elapsed   - the phase starts a fixed time into the pull
//   Emote     - the first matching boss emote starts the phase
// An encounter can hold any number of rules; boundaries are sorted by
// their resolved time at load, so rule order never matters.
//
// Rules are keyed by encounter id (straight from ENCOUNTER_START).
// Persistence stays with the caller (same arrangement as
// MobWeightSettings): toJson/fromJson round-trip through the settings
// cache, and this class keeps zero other dependencies.
